I needed something to duplicate bytes of files for programming a small file to a larger eeprom so I made this.

```
bindupe 0.1
Paul Sajna <sajattack@gmail.com>
Duplicates bytes of infile ndupes times in outfile

USAGE:
    bindupe <infile> <outfile> <ndupes>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

ARGS:
    <infile>     Sets the input file to use
    <outfile>    Sets the output file to use
    <ndupes>     Sets the number of times to duplicate bytes of infile to outfile
```
